BAD Programming Language
========================

no methods, no class; all code in main body

True:  non-zero
False: 0

Constructs:
	if [CONDITION] : [ACTION]
	if [CONDITION] : [ACTION]
	else [ACTION]

	while [CONDITION] : [ACTION]

	[ACTION]
		Something; or { Something; Someting; ... }


Variables:
	All variables are 32bit signed)
	var [name];			declaration
	$name				usage
	&name				adress
	$name = [VALUE]		Assignment

Math:
	&					(strongest)
	|
	^

	* / %
	+ -

	> < >= <= != ==		(weakest)

	( ) for backets

Pointers:
	every variable can be a pointer

	R-Value:
		$name gets Value stored inside variable
		&name gets pointer to variable

	L-Value:
		$name store value in variable
		*name store value in pointed variable

		var name;
		$name = 0x10000000;
		*name = k

Constants:
	1-9(0-9)*:  32bit integer number


ABI:
====

Start Variable Stack At 0x00100000 and allocate all variables there.

Registers: R2 and R3 used for Temp, stack for Calculations
